# Iron Chests (StationAPI)
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c1DH9VL.png" height=50 alt="Requires Fabric Kotlin">

Basic port of Iron Chests for b1.7.3 with Fabric, [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI) and
[Terminal](https://github.com/Zekromaster/Terminal)

Made in Kotlin more as an experiment than as an essential implementation choice
